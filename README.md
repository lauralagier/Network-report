On this report, I am going to describe my personal social links on Facebook. I have studied, lived and work in different parts of France and different countries so my social links are quite heterogeneous.  On my complete graph, I can distinguish 6 main clusters of friends that are not always connected together and that have their own particularities. Each cluster represents a different community with its specific interests, place of location and activities. 

- **Home cluster**: The violet cluster represents some members of my family and all the people I have met around the place I am from in France. It is a community of place that contains communities of circumstance and of interest.  In fact it includes my classmates from school, secondary school and high school, people that I have met in out-of-school activities, friends of friends that became my friends and members of my family that are off-centered in the cluster.
Life-size role play cluster: The orange cluster represents people I have met when I was doing life-size role play. This cluster is definitely a community of interest as people are coming from different part of France and from different professional area and generations.

- **MacDonald’s cluster**: The red cluster represents the people with who I have worked at MacDonald’s, it is a professional community.

- **Geneva cluster**: The pink cluster represents my classmates and the people I have met when I was studding at the University of Geneva. It is a student and place community that contains different communities of interest as each people was following a different university training: Ancient History and classical archeology or history and English or ancient history and literature… and so on.

- **History cluster**: The dark green cluster represents my classmates when I was doing my bachelor degree in History at the University of Jean Moulin in Lyon. It is a student and a place community but also a community of interest as we were all studding the same field  

- **Information science cluster**: The blue cluster represents my classmates at the University of Jean Moulin that are doing the master of library and information science with me. It is a student and a place community but also a community of interest as we are all studding the same field  

- **UCD cluster**: The acid green cluster represents all the people I have met at UCD. It is a community of place and circumstance as the majority of people are international students that I have met during the events organized by UCD for us. It also contains some of my classmates and people that I have met in the mountaineering club so we can also find some communities of interest.

In order to make these clusters clearer I ran the layout Force Atlas 2 and calculated the modularity to color each cluster in a different color. I also tried to highlight the nodes and edges by placing the nodes in a circle diameter. But in some clusters the nodes are too numerous so the edges are not really distinguishable. 

Each cluster is made of nodes that are linked with edges. Nodes represent people that are part of the cluster, and edges represent the social links between them. Bonding is the fact of creating social links between people, so it is represented by all the edges linking the nodes in one cluster. It allows seeing the relationship networks and the way people are influencing each other.  Nodes that are directly linked have a relationship of closeness. For example, Nicolas Jacquet and Béa Baz, in the information professional cluster, are closed because they are linked by an edge.

Some clusters are linked together when two people belonging to two different clusters know each other. It is called bridging, because these two people are creating a kind of bridge between two clusters. For example, in my graph, we can see that there is a bridge between the History cluster and the information science cluster. In fact, one of my classmates in information science has done a bachelor degree in History at the University of Jean Moulin and knows one of my classmates in the history cluster. 

In one cluster, it is possible to see influences between people by calculating the degrees of influence between them. To highlight these degrees, I decided to change the size of the nodes according to their influence in the cluster. For example, in the UCD cluster, Paddy Ireland, who is an event organizer for international students, has a large node or a strong centrality, which means that he is linked with a large majority of the other nodes in the cluster. So we can say that he has a strong influence in the cluster.

 But in the information professional cluster, the node sizes are quite equal because each person in the class is linked to each other. In other words, there is a betweenness relationship between each members of the cluster. We can’t see a centrality around one of them.
